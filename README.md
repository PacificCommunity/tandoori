# tandoori
Tools for projecting tuna operating models.

Uses the CppAD library for automatic differentiation (https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD).
An earlier version is used as it is header only and more convenient for packaging with R.

Also uses the LBFGSpp header-only library for the bounded BFGS solver (https://github.com/yixuan/LBFGSpp).

The use of the CppAD and LBFGSpp libraries is greatly appreciated!
